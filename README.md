When treating oral cancer, three surgical options—laser (TLM), robotic (TORS), and traditional open surgery—each offer distinct advantages and limitations. Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) uses a focused laser via the mouth to precisely remove tumors without external incisions. This approach allows for minimal damage to surrounding tissues, better voice and swallowing outcomes, and precise margin control under microscopic guidance 
Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS) similarly operates through the mouth but employs robotic arms with bendable instruments and a 3D camera. This dramatically improves access and accuracy in hard-to-reach areas like the base of tongue, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. TORS has been shown to reduce blood loss, shorten hospital stay, and lower complication rates compared to open surgery, while delivering comparable tumor control 
In contrast, traditional open surgery involves external incisions in the neck or jaw, which can lead to longer recovery times, more visible scars, and a higher likelihood of tracheostomy or feeding tube placement. It remains necessary for large tumors, extensive reconstruction, or advanced stages but tends to carry increased morbidity and longer hospital stays.
In summary, TLM and TORS are both minimally invasive and aim to preserve function and reduce recovery time. Laser surgery excels in precision and tissue-sparing for accessible tumors, whereas robotic surgery expands access to more complex regions with enhanced visualization and dexterity. Traditional surgery, while more invasive, remains indispensable for large or anatomically challenging tumors. The choice between them depends on tumor size, location, patient health, and the surgeon’s expertise.
